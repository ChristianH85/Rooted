# Rooted

Rooted is an app that helps the user find housing near their future tech job! It has been created specifically for people in the Tech world. It will be by the techie transplants moving to Austin that have little to no knowledge of the area and want to be close to where they work. The user will choose the company that they will be working at from a list of tech companies and the app will do a radial search of the area to provide them with available housing opportunities within their personal specifications. Users can save their favorite options in the database.

What makes this APP unique compared to other real estate search engines is that this will focus heavily on the company location that the user works at being the point zero origin for their search.
